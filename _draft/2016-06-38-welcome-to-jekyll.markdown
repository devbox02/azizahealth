The core strength of the Sportron product line is the sophistication of its nutritional supplements, which harness a unique technology known as FoodMatrix®.

FoodMatrix® is based on the work of Hungarian scientist, Andrew Szalay, who developed proprietary processes to concentrate micronutrients into food complexes. The technology is supported by recent research, including work by Nobel Prize winner, Dr Günter Blobel.
