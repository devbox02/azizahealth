Absorption is an over-used and often abused word. Most people who take food supplements are "sold" that one brand is better absorbed than another. Absorption, however, is not the complete story. Bioavailability covers absorption, retention, assimilation and utilization. Unless the supplement is high in all of these factors, the real benefit to our body can be very low. There is little benefit if the isolated nutrient, having been absorbed into the blood stream, cannot be assimilated by a solid organ such as the liver. If it is not assimilated, it cannot be retained or utilized on demand. The nutrient must also be delivered to the right place.
