WHAT MAKES FOODMATRIX® GPS BETTER?

#1 The FoodMatrix® Complex

FoodMatrix® nutrients are vitamins and minerals that are embedded into a living food matrix. FoodMatrix®, like real food, integrates the vitamin/mineral into a glycoprotein matrix. The body recognizes this as a true food-complex, NOT an isolated chemical, for superior absorption and assimilation into the body.

#2 The GPS (Guided Protein Supplement) Delivery SystemFoodMatrix GPS Supplements

FoodMatrix® GPS Nutrients utilize a proprietary delivery system. Attached to every FoodMatrix® GPS Nutrient is a "Unique Protein-Peptide Carrier" that transports and delivers the nutrient into the targeted cell. This ensures arrival of the nutrient to the correct destination.
